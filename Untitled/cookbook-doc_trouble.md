Analogy: trying to pin the tail on the donkey, or hit a pinata blindfolded


[Mine's troubleshooting tips:](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/teach-data-sci-icots2018/01-03-rmarkdown/01-03-rmarkdown.html#30)



+ Make sure RStudio and the rmarkdown package (and its dependencies) are up-to-date.

+ Set a global option for error = TRUE (or for a given chunk) so that your document renders even when there are errors.

+ Donâ€™t try to change working directory within an R Markdown document. (If you do still decide to use setwd in a code chunk, beware that the new working directory will only apply to that specific code chunk, and any following code chunks will revert back to use the original working directory.)

+ switch latex engines (do a screenshot here)
+ consider printing out your `sessionInfo()` [for pro-level, use DT]


```r
DT::datatable(devtools::session_info()$packages)
```
